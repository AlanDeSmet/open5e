**Saving Throws**

**Skills** Stealth +3

**Senses** Darkvision 60 ft.

**Languages** Common (understands but can’t speak)

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

**Damage Vulnerabilities** fire

**Multiattack**: The adherer slams twice.

**Adhesive**: An adherer exudes a sour smelling, gluelike substance that
is a powerful adhesive. Any creatures or items that touch it, except for
items made of stone, become stuck to the adherer. The adherer
automatically grapples and restrains any creature it hits with its slam
attack. It can grapple up to two opponents at one time. Grappling does
not reduce the adherer’s number of attacks. Creatures grappled this way
can break free with a successful DC 15 Str check. A weapon that strikes
an adherer is stuck to the creature unless the wielder succeeds on a DC
12 Dex saving throw. Pulling a stuck weapon free requires a successful
DC 12 Str check. Boiling water thrown on the adherer deals 1d6 points of
damage to it and to any creature grappled by the adherer. It also grants
tactical advantage on Dex saving throws and Str checks to free a weapon
or to escape from the adherer’s grapple; this bonus lasts for one round.
Inflicting fire damage on the adherer also weakens the adhesive,
granting tactical advantage on Dex saving throws and Str checks for 1d3
rounds. Universal solvent dissolves the adhesive instantly. An adherer
can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down
naturally one hour after the creature dies.

Actions

**Melee Attack—Slam**: +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). *Hit*: 1d8
+ 2 bludgeoning damage, and the target creature is grappled and
restrained (see Adhesive).

**Environment**: Temperate forests and subterranean

**Organization**: Solitary or gang (2–4)

This creature appears to be a withered humanoid wrapped in decaying
bandages. Upon close inspection, what appeared to be bandages are
actually loose folds of the creature’s rotting skin. A sour odor fills
the air around the creature.

Adherers are strange creatures found in forests and extensive cavern
networks. They stand 6 feet tall, weigh about 200 pounds, and closely
resemble mummies.

The difference is obvious on close inspection, but from more than 10
feet away, a successful DC 20 Int (Nature) check is needed to discern
the difference. They are not in fact related to mummies, nor are they
undead. Adherers are malign, living creatures that attack just about any
other creature they encounter.

Adherers always attack from ambush. When lying in wait, an adherer
covers its body with leaves, sticks, or other natural debris to blend
with its surroundings. When prey wanders too close, the adherer springs
to the attack. In this type of ambush, adherers always have tactical
advantage on their Stealth checks to determine surprise (+5). They are
cowardly creatures, however, and if spotted before they can spring their
ambush, they flee.
